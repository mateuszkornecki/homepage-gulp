## About the project 
This homepage was created during *WTF - Co ten frontend* course.<br>
The main goal this course was to learn essential knowledge of frontend engineers.

The main task for this website was to recreate my first project - [simple homepage](https://mateuszkornecki.github.io/homepage/) using newly learned technologies :<br>

The layout of this website was inspired by [material.io](https://material.io/).
